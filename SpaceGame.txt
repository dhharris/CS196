Description of game - Hugh Harris


This game is going to be an authentic space physics simulator where you can fly spacecraft 
and explore a variety of different planets. It will also have a survival aspect where you can
 gather resources as you work to survive harsh environments and dangerous creatures, create
 vehicles and form your own civilizations. Eventually you will be able to leave your home
 planet and colonize other systems, each having a different set of challenges. There will be two main sections of the game â€“ space and the surface worlds. The physics will be replicated
 as closely as possible to real life, with each planet having its own gravity, etc.
 You can play "survival mode" where you have to fight enemies and craft objects, 
or use "creative mode" if you just want to experience the physics engine. Think of a cross between Minecraft and KSP but with realistic physics.
